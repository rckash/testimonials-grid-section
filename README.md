## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I got my feet wet with CSS Grid. I learned using grid-template-rows and grid-template-columns to create basic grid layouts. I have also learned how to set up and use grid-template-area and grid-area.

Grid layouts have now opened me to the possibility of creating simple to complex layouts for multiple cards, images, etc.

### Continued development

Use this section to outline areas that you want to continue focusing on in future projects. These could be concepts you're still not completely comfortable with or techniques you found useful that you want to refine and perfect.
